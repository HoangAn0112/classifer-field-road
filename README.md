## Objective
Robust image classification (road and field) with a small dataset 
## Data: 
This dataset has 153 images for training and 10 images for testing, which is relatively small. Images within the same group are quite diverse, while some from different groups could look quite the same (example: fields images contain dirt paths between crop rows) (1)

The classes are imbalanced - road samples are almost double field samples, and 2 images have wrong labels (fields instead of roads) (2)

Also, samples donâ€™t have the same resolution and format (3)
